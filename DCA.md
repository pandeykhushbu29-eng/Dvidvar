========================================================

# Chapter 1 — Introduction

## 1.1 Overview

The Doublers Command Architecture (DCA) defines the processor execution architecture used by all processors implementing the Doublers ISA.

While the Doublers ISA specifies architectural behavior visible to software, the DCA specifies how compatible processors interpret, decode, and execute Doublers commands.

Every processor claiming compatibility with the Doublers Base ISA shall also implement the mandatory requirements defined by the corresponding DCA specification.

---

## 1.2 Objectives

The DCA is intended to provide:

* A standardized command architecture.
* Consistent processor behavior.
* Reliable command decoding.
* Efficient processor implementation.
* Long-term architectural stability.

---

## 1.3 Scope

The DCA defines:

* Command representation.
* Command decoding.
* Processor fetch behavior.
* Command execution pipeline.
* Register reference encoding.
* Immediate value representation.
* Command stream validation.
* Architectural alignment rules.

The DCA does not define processor microarchitecture.

Processor designers remain free to choose internal implementation techniques provided all externally visible behavior remains compliant.

---

## 1.4 Design Philosophy

The Doublers Command Architecture is based upon the following principles:

* Simplicity.
* Predictability.
* Compatibility.
* Hardware efficiency.
* Long-term extensibility.

All mandatory architectural behavior shall remain deterministic.

---

## 1.5 Relationship to the ISA

The ISA and DCA are complementary specifications.

The ISA defines:

* Instructions.
* Registers.
* Exceptions.
* Memory behavior.

The DCA defines:

* Command representation.
* Command decoding.
* Execution sequencing.

Neither specification replaces the other.

Both are required for a complete processor implementation.

---

## 1.6 Compliance

A processor is DCA-compatible only if it satisfies every mandatory requirement defined by this specification.

# Chapter 2 — Architectural Model

## 2.1 Purpose

The Doublers Command Architecture (DCA) defines the hardware execution model of a Doublers-compatible processor. While the Doublers ISA specifies the programmer-visible behavior of instructions, registers, memory, and exceptions, the DCA specifies how compatible hardware shall represent, fetch, decode, and execute those instructions.

This chapter defines the architectural model common to all compliant Doublers processors.

---

## 2.2 Architectural Independence

The Doublers ISA is independent of any particular processor implementation.

A processor may differ internally in:

- Pipeline depth
- Cache organization
- Clock frequency
- Internal scheduling
- Execution width
- Power management
- Physical layout

provided that all externally visible architectural behavior remains fully compatible with the Doublers ISA and this DCA.

---

## 2.3 Processor Components

A compliant Doublers processor shall consist of the following logical components.

### Command Fetch Unit

Responsible for obtaining the next command from memory.

---

### Command Decode Unit

Responsible for interpreting the fetched command into its architectural operation.

---

### Execution Unit

Responsible for executing the decoded operation.

---

### Register System

Stores all architecturally visible processor registers.

---

### Memory Interface

Performs architectural memory accesses.

---

### Exception Controller

Detects and reports architectural exceptions.

---

### Program Counter Logic

Maintains the location of the currently executing command.

---

## 2.4 Architectural State

The architectural state of a Doublers processor consists of:

- General-purpose registers
- Special registers
- Program Counter (PC)
- Status/Flag registers
- Architecturally visible memory
- Pending architectural exceptions

Temporary implementation-specific state shall not be architecturally visible.

---

# 2.5 Electrical State Model

The Doublers processor operates using three active hardware states during normal execution.

These states describe the electrical representation used internally by compatible hardware implementations.

Software shall never directly manipulate these electrical states.

---

## Active States

### State 2 — High

Represents the High electrical state.

This state is an active computational state.

---

### State 4 — Mid

Represents the Mid electrical state.

This state is an active computational state.

---

### State 8 — Low

Represents the Low electrical state.

This state is an active computational state.

---

## Power State

### State 10 — OFF

Represents the processor power-off condition.

When a processor is in the OFF state:

- No commands are fetched.
- No commands are decoded.
- No instructions execute.
- No architectural state changes occur.

The OFF state is not an architectural execution state.

It shall never appear within a valid command stream.

It shall never be interpreted as an instruction.

It shall never be referenced by software.

The OFF state exists solely as the physical condition in which the processor is unpowered.

---

## 2.6 Hardware Interpretation

Hardware designers shall implement reliable mechanisms for distinguishing the active electrical states.

The exact voltage levels, timing characteristics, transistor implementations, or signaling techniques are implementation-defined.

Only the architectural meanings of States 2, 4, and 8 are standardized by the DCA.

---

## 2.7 Software Visibility

Programs executing under the Doublers ISA shall remain completely unaware of the processor's electrical implementation.

The ISA operates solely on architectural instructions, registers, memory, and exceptions.

The electrical representation defined by the DCA is considered an implementation detail and shall not affect software compatibility.

---

## 2.8 Compliance

A processor is DCA-compliant if it:

- Correctly implements the Doublers ISA.
- Correctly represents the three active electrical states.
- Correctly handles the OFF power condition.
- Preserves all architecturally visible behavior defined by the ISA and DCA.

Implementation-specific optimizations are permitted provided they do not alter observable architectural behavior.

# Chapter 3 — Command Representation

## 3.1 Overview

The Doublers Command Architecture represents executable programs as ordered sequences of architectural commands.

Each command represents one complete operation defined by the Doublers ISA.

Processors shall interpret commands according to the rules defined by this specification.

---

## 3.2 Architectural Command Unit

The Architectural Command Unit (ACU) is the smallest executable unit recognized by a DCA-compatible processor.

Every valid program consists of one or more ACUs arranged in execution order.

Processors shall fetch, decode, and execute commands one ACU at a time.

---

## 3.3 Command Identity

Each ACU shall uniquely identify a single ISA instruction.

The command representation shall provide sufficient information to determine:

* Instruction identity.
* Operand requirements.
* Register references.
* Immediate data requirements.
* Execution behavior.

---

## 3.4 Human Representation

For documentation and software development, commands may be represented using human-readable mnemonic names.

Example:

* LOAD
* STORE
* ADD
* SUB
* JMP
* CALL
* RET
* SYSCALL

The human-readable form is intended solely for software development and documentation.

Processors operate upon the DCA command representation rather than textual mnemonics.

---

## 3.5 Command Stream

Programs shall consist of sequential ACUs.

The Program Counter always references the next ACU to be fetched.

Unless modified by architectural control-flow instructions, command execution proceeds sequentially.

---

## 3.6 Command Completeness

Every ACU shall contain all information required for correct architectural decoding.

Processors shall not depend upon information contained within neighboring commands.

Each command shall remain independently decodable.

---

## 3.7 Command Categories

Architectural commands may belong to one of the following categories:

* Arithmetic
* Logical
* Memory
* Comparison
* Branch
* Stack
* System
* Privileged
* Miscellaneous

Future compatible community additions may introduce additional categories.

---

## 3.8 Operand Description

A command may reference:

* Zero operands
* One operand
* Two operands
* Three operands

The required operand count is determined by the instruction definition within the Doublers ISA.

---

## 3.9 Immediate Data

Commands requiring immediate values shall explicitly include those values within the command representation.

Immediate values shall never be inferred from surrounding commands.

Encoding rules are defined in later chapters.

---

## 3.10 Register References

Commands referencing processor registers shall explicitly identify those registers.

Register identifiers shall correspond to the register definitions contained within the Doublers ISA.

---

## 3.11 Reserved Fields

Command representations may contain reserved fields for future architectural growth.

Software shall not depend upon reserved field values.

Processors shall preserve reserved behavior as defined by this specification.

---

## 3.12 Invalid Representation

An ACU that cannot be decoded according to this specification shall immediately generate an Illegal Command Exception.

No architectural state shall be modified before the exception is generated.

---

## 3.13 Forward Compatibility

Future DCA revisions may introduce additional command fields while preserving compatibility with existing command representations whenever practical.

Previously defined command fields shall retain their architectural meaning unless explicitly revised by a future major version.

---

## 3.14 Compliance

A DCA-compatible processor shall correctly recognize, decode, and validate every Architectural Command Unit defined by this specification before execution.

Commands not conforming to the DCA representation shall not be executed.

# Chapter 4 — Command Fetch Architecture

## 4.1 Overview

The Command Fetch Architecture defines how a DCA-compatible processor retrieves Architectural Command Units (ACUs) from memory prior to execution.

Every processor shall implement a reliable and deterministic command fetch mechanism.

---

## 4.2 Fetch Sequence

The processor shall perform the following operations during command fetch:

1. Read the Program Counter.
2. Locate the next ACU.
3. Verify fetch accessibility.
4. Retrieve the complete ACU.
5. Forward the ACU to the decoder.

No execution shall occur during the fetch stage.

---

## 4.3 Program Counter

The Program Counter (PC) always references the first unit of the next command.

After successful execution, the PC advances according to the length of the fetched command unless modified by architectural control-flow instructions.

---

## 4.4 Sequential Fetch

Commands shall normally be fetched in sequential order.

Sequential fetch continues until interrupted by:

* JMP
* CALL
* RET
* Conditional Branches
* Exceptions
* Interrupts

---

## 4.5 Fetch Permissions

Processors shall verify that the command location is executable before fetching.

Attempting to fetch from a non-executable region shall generate an Execute Protection Exception.

---

## 4.6 Fetch Alignment

Commands shall begin at valid architectural command boundaries.

Processors shall reject improperly aligned commands according to this specification.

---

## 4.7 Partial Fetch Prevention

Processors shall never decode partially fetched commands.

If the complete ACU cannot be retrieved, execution shall stop and the appropriate architectural exception shall be generated.

---

## 4.8 Branch Fetch

Following a successful branch, jump, call, or return, the next fetch shall begin at the updated Program Counter value.

---

## 4.9 Fetch Exceptions

The fetch stage may generate:

* Execute Protection Exception
* Memory Protection Exception
* Illegal Command Exception

No architectural state shall be modified before the exception is delivered.

Every command shall be decoded independently.

The decoder shall not require information from previous or subsequent commands to determine the meaning of the current command.

---

## 5.8 Decode Completion

Successful decoding produces an internal architectural representation suitable for execution.

The structure of this internal representation is implementation-defined.

---

## 5.9 Future Compatibility

Future DCA revisions may define additional command fields while preserving compatibility with previously defined command representations whenever practical.

---

Processors shall execute commands in the order specified by the command stream unless modified by architectural control-flow operations.

---

## 10.2 Command Stream Definition

A command stream is a contiguous sequence of valid ACUs beginning at a designated entry point.

The command stream represents the executable portion of a Doublers program.

---

## 10.3 Stream Entry

Execution begins at the architectural entry point defined by the executing program.

The Program Counter shall be initialized to this entry point before the first command is fetched.

---

## 10.4 Sequential Progression

Following successful execution, the processor shall advance to the next ACU in the stream.

The architectural execution pipeline consists of the following stages:

1. Fetch
2. Decode
3. Validate
4. Execute
5. Commit
6. Advance

Processors shall preserve the architectural behavior of these stages regardless of internal implementation.

---

## 11.3 Fetch Stage

The Fetch stage retrieves the next Architectural Command Unit using the current Program Counter.

---

## 11.7 Commit Stage

The Commit stage updates architectural state.

Examples include:

* Register updates
* Memory writes
* FLAGS modifications
* Program Counter changes

State modifications shall occur atomically from the perspective of software.

---

## 11.8 Advance Stage

Following successful commit, the Program Counter advances to the next Architectural Command Unit unless modified by architectural control-flow operations.

---

## 11.9 Pipeline Flexibility

Processor implementations may employ:

* Single-cycle execution
* Multi-cycle execution
* Pipelining
* Superscalar execution

Commands requiring elevated privilege shall verify the current processor privilege level before execution.

Failure shall generate a Privilege Exception.

---

## 12.7 Memory Verification

Commands accessing memory shall verify:

* Read permission.
* Write permission.
* Execute permission (when applicable).

Permission violations shall generate the corresponding architectural exception.
